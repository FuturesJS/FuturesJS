FuturesJS - The simple asynchronous toolkit.

It's a JavaScript flow-control library
(or control-flow - however you like to say it)
with the aim of being simple and intuitive.

It doesn't use promises in the strictest sense
of the definition, but does help tame your wild,
async code.

FuturesJS v3 (aka 'Diet Cola')
===

Status: Maintained, In Development

v3.x is simply an experiment in making FuturesJS
more **browser-friendly**, simpler, **smaller**,
and more *intuitively obvious, even to the most casual observer*!

For v3 each module has been split into its own repository in <https://github.com/FuturesJS>.

Completed thus far:

  * [`join`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/join)
  * [`forEachAsync`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/forEachAsync)
  * [`ArrayAsync`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/ArrayAsync)
    * `someAsync`
    * `everyAsync`
    * `filterAsync`
    * `mapAsync`
    * `reduceAsync`
    * `reduceRightAsync`
  * [`forAllAsync`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/forAllAsync)
  * [`lateral`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/lateral)
  * [`sequence`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/sequence)

In progress:

  * [`asyncify`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/asyncify)
  * [`chainify`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/chainify)
  * [`future`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/future)
  * [`loop`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/loop)

Don't worry, v2
