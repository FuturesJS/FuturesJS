FuturesJS - The simple asynchronous toolkit.

FuturesJS is a JavaScript flow-control library
(or control-flow - however you like to say it)
with the aim of being simple and intuitive.

It doesn't use promises in the strictest sense
of the definition, but does help tame your wild,
async code.

FuturesJS v3 (aka 'Diet Cola')
===

Status: Maintained, In Development

<https://github.com/FuturesJS>

v3.x is simply an experiment in making FuturesJS
more **browser-friendly**, simpler, **smaller**,
and more *intuitively obvious, even to the most casual observer*!

Completed thus far (release candidate status):

  * [`forEachAsync`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/forEachAsync)
  * [`ArrayAsync`](https://github.com/FuturesJS/ArrayAsync)
    * `someAsync`
    * `everyAsync`
    * `filterAsync`
    * `mapAsync`
    * `reduceAsync`
    * `reduceRightAsync`

FuturesJS v2

Status: Maintained

Don't worry, v2
is still supported and probably always will be.

<https://github.com/FuturesJS/FuturesJS/tree/v2.0>

The version isn't inactive. It's simply complete.
If you do find a bug, however, please report it.

FuturesJS v1

Status: Deprecated

<https://github.com/FuturesJS/FuturesJS/tree/v1.0>

This version is not active, nor is it complete.
If you find bugs, I don't want to hear about them.
